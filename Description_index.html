This is the first line

My site will be a sport training and fitness tracking website: 
1 Focus on running and basketball
2 Will have features to enter and track previous workouts
3 Links to instructional videos for each sport depending on skill

Assignment 2: Outline of main goals:
1)For the main home page you should be able to navigate to the desired sport you want to learn about or log your training for
2)Once you enter that specific sport then you will have options to log your training by either following a link to a pre-existing logger website (like mapMyRun.com) or maybe it will be implemented there. Also there will be a section for instructional videos that will be grouped by category of trainig. Ex: for basketball could have sections for:
	a. Coaching
	b. Shooting
	c. Defense
	d. Drills
	e. Offensive set
	f. ect...
